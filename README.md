# Potato-Disease-detection
This project utilizes deep learning to classify the health of potato plants. It typically focuses on detecting three primary states: Healthy, Early Blight (Alternaria solani), and Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans).

Building a Potato Disease Detection Model with TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) involves creating an automated system that identifies crop pathogens by analyzing digital images of leaves. In 2025, these systems are essential for early diagnosis, helping farmers prevent up to 26% of yield losses and reduce the need for manual, expert-intensive inspections.
